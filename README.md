# QRCards
**Scan, Share, Spread**

QRCards are business cards with one simple feature: a QR code directing a user to `qrcards.github.io`. This website logs their approximate location based on their IP address and shows them every place (with not much accuracy) where a QRCard has been scanned. It's that simple. I coded this and designed the cards in a few days.
